# Filter and select qualified players from a game leaderboard (⭐⭐)

## Exercise description:

Implement the GetQualifiedPlayers method that takes a dictionary of player names and their scores.

Your goal is to build a list of players who qualify for the next round based on the following rules:

    A player must have a score of at least 50 to qualify.

    If a player has a score of 100 or more, the process should stop immediately—this may indicate suspected cheating or a system rule violation. However, any players who qualified before this point should still be included in the result.

    Return the list of names of players who qualified before any disqualifying score was encountered.


What you'll practice:

    Using foreach loops with continue and break

    Filtering a dictionary based on multiple conditions

    Working with collections and building a result list

    Avoiding magic numbers by using named constants

    Optionally, using LINQ with TakeWhile, Where, and Select methods


Example usage:

    var players = new Dictionary<string, int>
    {
        { "Anna", 45 },
        { "Ben", 80 },
        { "Uki", 70 },
        { "Cara", 100 }, //cheating score - we should stop right there
        { "Derek", 90 },
        { "Ella", 70 }
    };
     
    var result = Exercise.GetQualifiedPlayers(players);
    // result: ["Ben", "Uki"]
